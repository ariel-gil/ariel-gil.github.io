    <h3>Tools I use</h3>
    <p>Following the example of <a href="https://danielpaleka.com/what-i-use" target="_blank">Daniel Paleka</a>, here's some tools I use:</p>
    
    <h4>Software:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Obsidian</strong> for basic note taking. I went from Evernote, to Onenote, to Notion, and finally to Obsidian in early 2023. I am pretty happy with it other than the mobile sync. Since I have google docs inside my vault, I need to use the google drive sync.</li>
        <li><strong>PARA</strong> - note taking system, originally by Tiago Forte. I dont think its very well suited for PKM, which is what I initially switched to Obsidian for. It needs a bit of tweaking to make PKM work without devolving into a mess - which I am currently trying to fix. I think PARA is great though!</li>
        <li><strong>Readwise Reader</strong> - reading app, nice solution for impulse reading, and also puts all my newsletters in one place (instead of in email)</li>
        <li><strong>Snipd</strong> - good podcast app with Readwise/obsidian sync and AI summary features. I dont listen to podcasts that much, but I got the early adopter pricing.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimallist launcher</strong> on Android</li>
        <li><strong>"Intently" app</strong> for intentionality prompts. Might write a full post on it, this is a pretty awesome app that mostly removed my need for any other phone usage restrictions or weird experiments with eink phones.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge browser</strong> - I liked firefox, but the vertical tabs in Edge are great. Its also ok-ish ram wise</li>
        <li><strong>"Voice-in" browser extension</strong> for voice transcription to use in Claude etc</li>
        <li><strong>Dark Reader extension</strong> - I got used to dark mode, and this extension makes the entire web dark with pretty good customizations as well. I use -15 contrast, -20 brightness, though this is highly screen dependent</li>
        <li><strong>Todoist</strong> for task management - used to use Workflowy, but it doesnt work for me anymore. Todoist is mostly ok, though I am sure theres a better one.</li>
        <li><strong>Cursor and Claude code</strong> for light programming</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Hardware:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dell Precision 5560</strong> - the engineer's version of the XPS15, sharing a chassis but housing a workstation grade GPU (RTX A2000 4GB). Its a great laptop, but it wasnt the most reliable. I got it in 2022, and my motherboard died 1.5 years in. Luckily, it was under warrenty and replaced. Recently I swapped the battery and keyboard (some keys were intermittently failing), and it now feels fresh and ready for another few years. </li>
        <li><strong>Boox Nova Air (7.8in)</strong> - I really like eink. I've had this device since 2022 and its still running great. I think the stylus experience is better than an iPad (without a paper-like screen protector), making it fun to write on. Form factor is best for books, and too small to read papers on comfortably without constantly squinting/zooming around. Might at some point get the larger one. It doesnt get security updates, but it has full android. So syncing EPUBs to it via google drive is easy.</li>
        <li><strong>Anker GAN 65w charger</strong> - my Dell laptop charger is normally 130W, and super heavy. Theres a slight clock speed penalty at 65W, but for my use case its a great weight/size saving (~450g!).</li>
        <li><strong>Alpine Musicsafe Pro earplugs</strong> - I do salsa, and also go to an ocasional concert. My ears are pretty sensitive, and in general I dont want to lose any more of my hearing. These are good, though I think my old amazon bought cheap ones were more comfortable if I need to use them for sleep at a hostel.</li>
        <li>That's it, mostly - I dont have that many things worth talking about here, as I have been travelling pretty light. Battery bank and some adapter cables are pretty standard travel items, as well as little organizer bags.</li> 
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Supplements:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vitamin D3</strong> - basically everyone is deficient. I take 1000IU for many years now</li>
        <li><strong>Magnesium</strong> - It aparently has sleep benefits, I take it for muscle tightness. After an Injury, my IT band / TFL is prone to tightness, and this possibly helps.</li>
        <li><strong>Curcumin</strong> - helps inflamation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Travel Gear:</h4>
    <p>I like travelling light, especially when spending a few months living out of a backpack. My setup is now pretty decent, with an old 44L Osprey Talon hiking pack (its not ultralight but at 1.2kg empty its not far), and a vintage patagonia waterproof backpack I use as a computer bag, plus a few essentials.</p>
    
    <p>This works as a carry on setup in most airlines (patagonia bag fits under seat, Osprey in top compartment). Total weight of setup is 12kg, which includes a 2.2kg laptop, 2 phones, and clothing down to ~0C. It might be possible to fit everything in the Osprey, but I prefer the flexibility - Neither bag is fully stuffed, which means I have room for snacks if I expect to be in less grocery friendly places.</p>
    
    <p>To get down to this weight, I had to mostly bring technical clothing (nicer looking Colombia hiking pants) and no Jeans. A good Decathalon rain coat has been helpful a few times, and serves as the wind blocking layer above a fleece.</p>
    
    <p>Most random but useful item: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scissors-Protective-Precision-Straight-Scrapbooking/dp/B0C7LSRQ4R?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.QNwpriuCQyGOEZ9pQWLSd175raqZ8MiR6KraObQOTX30tlo-8oGA5VUgV1kIfwYGimYzGIEaFC7XbgImLM37TA1l-3N-h29CnB8P6EXtIvgGJb1LFhN9zhCVrfROHWeLT9Kbg6Gn4y2snUvTUpkUvKIp1vtnX8a_qhJkDXOPgBuEYSBzVdE5zaMW_-nvNpRuP6JgvoHowSLwFHF4Dir9m741W9ZyD69EH8cEj00gP9EGoYT5iVqf6QrI9g-gc3U4ibPXO1_bhsZmsnzM-QloKj6yMnl2D-q60BxIC9nni3c.HFwotYterNpQl6RpCSJlFlxbkrvqY02MmLq8ZMlJDVY&dib_tag=se&keywords=travel+scissors+tsa+approved&qid=1767040961&sr=8-7" target="_blank">TSA approved scissors</a>. Seems dumb, but I've been glad to have these more than a few times. Also, laundry mesh bags have been great.</p>
