- title: "Biking"
  description: "I like mountain biking quite a bit, but also like road biking - especially on 70s steel frame \"10-spd\" bikes. I have a 1972 Czech bike that I found used for cheap. I find that these bikes dont break, and they ride nicer than newer bikes. For me, biking isnt an adrenaline rush, but more of just a fun way to get into a flow state, and also do physical activity in nature. Same goes for motorcycles - I dont enjoy the thrill, but I like how it enables a new way to explore outdoors."

- title: "Typewriters"
  description: "Other old things I like are typewriters - especially the semi-electric ones that still have the ribbon pressing action, but are a bit faster to type on. I've written various notes during COVID that I never published, and hope to get back to using it once I am back from travelling."

  description: "I've had some on/off interest in motorcycles, and recently did a 4-day trip in the Peruvian Andes. A few years ago, I also borrowed a pretty interesting Honda CBR250RR bike."

- title: "Cars"
  description: "Cars have been a big part of my childhood, and later also my engineering degree. I really like the 70's F1 history - where innovation was still wild and step-wise, rather than incremental. The Brabham \"Fan Car\" is one example. I like the idea of \"finding a loophole/lucky break\" and exploiting it to win against the more rule-following competition. Cars were for me perhaps just a fun medium to play around with innovation, before moving on to other things."

- title: "Metal Working"
  description: "I used to do quite a bit of metal working. I find it satisfying, and would like to get back to it - welding, machining, getting laser cut parts and putting them together. Metal working is harder than woodworking, but I think more satisfying."
