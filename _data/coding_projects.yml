- title: "Browser Tab Visualization"
  description: "Browser extension for visualizing open tabs in several ways. Maybe wont be necessary once Agents get good, but I still hate scrolling through 100 tabs. The idea was to have several ways of simultaniously visualizing (and managing) tabs, possibly with a bit of AI but likely not needed. A bit inspired by Chrome 'journeys'. See [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ariel-gil/tab-visualization)"

- title: "Progressive Summarization MVP"
  description: "Tiago Forte's progressive summarization with LLM. Doesnt really work yet UI wise. It would be cool to run it on Cerberus with dynamic real time 'zooming in and out' of a document. See [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ariel-gil/progressive_summarization)"
