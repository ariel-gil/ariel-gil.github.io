- title: "Tire & Vehicle Dynamics Modeling"
  description: "3-year research project involving 300+ hours of MATLAB data analysis of empirical tire data and vehicle dynamics modeling. Built car/racetrack models for  performance optimization. See [Github Project](https://github.com/ariel-gil/Tire_vehicle_dynamics_modelling) with more details and Code. This work was later used for in a [\"team strategy\" research project](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392030237_POINT_SENSITIVITY_Racecar_Design_Parameter_Analysis_for_Competition_Targets) working top-down to define design requirements based on competition performance targets. (see below)"

- title: "University Racecar Engineering"
  description: "Led a 35-person university racecar engineering team to 28th place out of 110 international teams in the '[Formula SAE](https://www.fsaeonline.com/)' competition, with a target top-10 finish the following year (competition cancelled due to COVID). Responsible for vehicle dynamics modeling, tire data analysis, and overall system integration. Over 300 hours of MATLAB data analysis and research over 3 years. See published [strategy/vehicle modeling](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392030237_POINT_SENSITIVITY_Racecar_Design_Parameter_Analysis_for_Competition_Targets) work and [Electric Racecar capstone thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392028874_Development_of_an_Electric_Powertrain_System_for_a_Formula_SAE_Race_Car) project"

- title: "Offroad Racecar"
  description: "Technical lead for offroad university racecar design team ([Baja SAE](https://www.bajasae.net/)), responsible for suspension, steering, and ergonomics. The 2018-2019 car featured unusual (perhaps innovative?) kinematics with 70/30 weight distribution, short wheelbase, and high ground clearance, as well as long uncut bent tubing for easier welding."

- title: "Medical Robotics Startup (Forsight Robotics)"
  description: "Early member (#4) of a semi-autonomous ophthalmic surgical robotics startup that grew to 50+ employees and raised $50M within ~1 year. Worked on end effector, surgical tools, system integration, force-feedback joystick design, and ergonomics testing. Iterated Vision/tool-tip tracking requirements with CV team, and learned about challenges in ML risk management (even for simple non-closed loop tracking). Conducted usability studies comparing robotic vs manual surgery with surgeons."
