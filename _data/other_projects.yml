- title: "University Racecar Engineering"
  description: "Led a 35-person university racecar engineering team to 28th place out of 110 international teams in the '[Formula SAE](https://www.fsaeonline.com/)' competition, with a target top-10 finish the following year (competition cancelled due to COVID). Responsible for vehicle dynamics modeling, tire data analysis, and overall system integration. Over 300 hours of MATLAB data analysis and research over 3 years. See published strategy/vehicle modeling work, and Electric Racecar capstone project"
