A few random hobbies. 
I like hiking and seeing new places, and have recently done a trip to Peru. It was my first non-western country, and it was a great experience.

I like mountain biking quite a bit, but also like road biking - especially on 70s steel frame "10-spd" bikes. I have a 1972 Czech bike that I found used for cheap. I find that these bikes dont break, and they ride nicer than newer bikes.

Other old things I like are typewriters - especially the semi-electric ones that still have the ribbon pressing action, but are a bit faster to type on. I've written various notes during COVID that I never published, and hope to get back to using it once I am back from travelling.

I've had some on/off interest in motorcycles, and recently did a 4-day trip in the Peruvian Andes. A few years ago, I also borrowed a pretty interesting Honda CBR250RR bike.

Cars have been a big part of my childhood, and later also my engineering degree. I really like the 70's F1 history - where innovation was still wild and step-wise, rather than incremental. The Brabham "Fan Car" is one example. I like the idea of "finding a loophole/lucky break" and exploiting it to win against the more rule-following competition. Cars were for me perhaps just a fun medium to play around with innovation, before moving on to other things.

I used to do quite a bit of metal working. I find it satisfying, and would like to get back to it - welding, machining, getting laser cut parts and putting them together. Metal working is harder than woodworking, but I think more satisfying.
