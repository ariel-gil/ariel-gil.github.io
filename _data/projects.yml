- title: "AI Scheming Research"
  description: "A small AI Scheming research project testing whether coding assistants will deceive clients to avoid implementing insecure code. This work explores the potential for AI systems to engage in deceptive behavior when faced with requests that could compromise security. [Project details](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rQWHwazYsBi97jMBg/scheming-toy-environment-incompetent-client)"

- title: "AI Standards Lab"
  description: "Co-leading a nonprofit focused on supporting the development of standards and risk management frameworks for AI systems. We aim to bridge technical research with practical implementation work (translating research into a format suited for standards bodies). So far, we have focused on CEN-CENELEC JTC21 standards for the \"High-Risk\" systems in the AI Act, as well as the Codes of Practice."

- title: "Discernment/Scalable oversight"
  description: "I am writing a paper exploring what can be called the \"discernment problem\" - scalable oversight failures specifically when using AI systems to automate AI safety research. I think that there's a chance we will hit this bottleneck soon, and it might make iterative alignment strategies less likely to work. I am trying to take different angles to it from the governance side - maybe as a policy brief, or maybe to give a better sense of the issue and what we can do about it. 

See my [governance preprint](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391987459_When_Control_Succeeds_but_Discernment_Fails_Preparing_for_AI-Assisted_Safety_Research) and my [technical research proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C980KdYo1C5ExsGj5ws9RVvrvUBxdgayqy8ujE25_rk/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.kc4qd7rv92ah) which I am working on in parallel."

- title: "Short Timelines Thinking"
  description: "I am starting to look into governance for shorter timelines. In my EU standards work, it was hard to zoom out and think big picture, as it felt a bit irrelevant for the day-to-day work of implementing the AI Act (e.g. in the Codes of Practice and JTC21 standards). Now I am starting to zoom out, and see what I can do in this space."
