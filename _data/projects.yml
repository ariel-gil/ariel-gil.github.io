- title: "Discernment/Scalable Oversight"
  description: "I am developing a technical research agenda (and also wrote a governance paper) testing the \"discernment problem\" - scalable oversight failures specifically when using AI systems to automate AI safety research. I think there's a chance we will hit this bottleneck soon, and it might make iterative alignment strategies less likely to work. 
  
  See my [governance preprint](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391987459_When_Control_Succeeds_but_Discernment_Fails_Preparing_for_AI-Assisted_Safety_Research) and my [technical research proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C980KdYo1C5ExsGj5ws9RVvrvUBxdgayqy8ujE25_rk/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.kc4qd7rv92ah), which I am working on in parallel."
